# Assignment: Build a 2D Survival Game in Godot 4

**Due Date:** `Sunday, May 18 @ 11:59 PM`
**Weight:** **2x**

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment you will be able to:

1. Follow a multi-step video tutorial and translate it into working Godot code.
2. Use TileMaps, instancing, and signals to spawn collectibles and enemies.
3. Implement basic player inventory, combat, and cutscene mechanics.
4. Work in Git: commit often with clear messages.

## 🎮 Assignment Overview

In this assignment you will follow a video tutorial series on building a 2D survival game in Godot 4. This youtube playlist has 11 videos, each about 15-20 minutes long. That is a total of about 4 hours of video content.

### Assignment Requirements
- Watch one video each day (two videos if less than 15 minutes). Follow along and code the features shown in the video.
- Make at least **2 commits per video**
  - One commit for the base setup or partial feature
  - One commit for the completed feature  

All of the resources are linked below. You will be using a starter project that has the basic structure set up for you. You will need to clone this repo and create your own GitHub Classroom assignment.

## 🔗 Resources

* **Playlist:** "How to Make Survival Game in Godot" (11 videos, \~4 h 18 m total)
  [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3cGrGHvkwn2NOT1LSwf5d2XZmlc5Bjsn](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3cGrGHvkwn2NOT1LSwf5d2XZmlc5Bjsn)
* **Starter Project:** [GitHub Repo Template](https://github.com/your-org/godot-survival-template)
* **Godot 4.0 Download:** [https://godotengine.org/download](https://godotengine.org/download)

## 📝 Task Breakdown

1. **Clone the starter repo** and create your own GitHub Classroom assignment.
2. **Watch each video** in order and code along-do **exactly** what's shown (no copy/paste!).
3. Make **2 commits per video** (you can do more but keep the commit format same):

   * **Commit 1:** "\[Video #X] Base setup & partial feature"
   * **Commit 2:** "\[Video #X] Completed feature"
4. After all videos, add **one** stretch goal of your choice (e.g. a new enemy type, health bar, or extra cutscene).
5. **Test** your game: it should run without errors, and include every core mechanic from the tutorial.

## 🚀 Submission

* Host your work on a **public GitHub repo** (linked via GitHub Classroom).
* Include a **README** describing your stretch goal and how to run the project.
* Attach or link a **short screencast (1-2 min)** demonstrating:

  1. Player movement & collection
  2. Inventory UI
  3. Combat & enemy behavior
  4. One cutscene trigger

| • +1 pt per extra meaningful commit (max +5) |             |


*Total: 100 pt*

### Tips

* **Branch per feature**: e.g. `video-03-collectibles`, merge back to `main`.
* Write **descriptive commits**: "Implement TileMap auto-tiling" > "Done things".
* Use Godot's **built-in profiler** if you hit performance hitches.
* **Ask early** on Discord/office hours if you get stuck!
